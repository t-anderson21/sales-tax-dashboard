# sales-tax-dashboard
As part of my internship for the Utah County Office of the Auditor, I developed an interactive Sales Tax Revenue Dashboard using RShiny to provide comprehensive insights into sales tax trends and performance metrics. This dashboard enables users to explore and visualize key revenue data, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning. You can access the dashboard at https://t-anderson177.shinyapps.io/sales_tax_dashboard/. Please note that the bulk of the underlying code is hidden to ensure data privacy and to protect ongoing project work. I am excited to share this tool and look forward to its potential impact on our data analysis initiatives.
